## Sales Positioning Scripts

### Against Dext (General)
"While Dext excels at receipt/expense scanning and now offers payment execution (UK Xero only), Lightyear provides complete AP automation with upstream controls. We focus on preventing payment errors before they happen—through purchase order workflows, 3-way matching, and automated price verification against your supplier agreements."

### For SMBs
"If you only need receipt scanning, Dext works. But if you're managing suppliers, purchase orders, and need to prevent overcharging, Lightyear's automated price checking pays for itself by catching supplier pricing errors before payment."

### For Franchises
"Dext's multi-entity is basic. Lightyear's parent/child dashboards with unlimited companies and hospitality POS integrations are purpose-built for franchises and multi-location businesses."

### Addressing Dext Payments (NEW)
"Dext now handles payment execution in-platform (UK Xero only), which streamlines the back-end workflow. Lightyear's differentiation is upstream—we prevent payment errors through PO controls, 3-way matching, and price verification before invoices ever reach the payment stage. Dext streamlines paying invoices; Lightyear ensures you're paying the right amount to the right supplier."
